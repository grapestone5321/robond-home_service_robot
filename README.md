# robond-home_service_robot
Udacity robond home service robot project

## Project Submission

### Summary of Tasks

Letâ€™s summarize what should be done in this project to simulate a home service robot

1. Design a simple environment with the Building Editor in Gazebo.
2. Teleoperate your robot and manually test SLAM.
3. Create a wall_follower node that autonomously drives your robot to map your environment.
4. Use the ROS navigation stack and manually commands your robot using the 2D Nav Goal arrow in rviz to move to 2 different desired positions and orientations.
5. Write a pick_objects node that commands your robot to move to the desired pickup and drop off zones. 
6. Write an add_markers node that subscribes to your robot odometry, keeps track of your robot pose, and publishes markers to rviz. 

### Evaluation

Once you get a working home service robot, check the Project Rubric to see if it meets the specifications listed. If you meet the specifications, then you are ready to submit the project!

### Here are the files that you need to include in your project submission

- Your catkin_ws/src directory which includes: 
  - The official ROS packages that you downloaded
  - C++ packages and nodes
